# Language mappings for anticheat-test.com
### this is still a WIP so new strings will be added

# Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, please use the english.json file as a base and work off that

avoid using Google Translate and if you are unsure about translating something don't modify it

you also may see messages like "%s message" do not modify the "%s" this is used for formatting changing this will break the language

for texture ids I use https://minecraft-heads.com if you find a head matching the language you can also use that


# Important - read before making a pull request/committing
Please ensure new languages are also setup in "loader_mappings.json" otherwise it wont be deployed to any servers

Also make sure your JSON file is correct by running it through a parser [using a tool like this](https://jsonformatter.org/json-parser)
