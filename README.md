Pull requests are welcome, please use the english.json file as a base and work off that

avoid using Google Translate and if you are unsure about translating something don't modify it

You also may see messages like "%s message" do not modify the "%s" this is used for formatting changing this will break the language

for texture ids I use https://minecraft-heads.com if you find a head matching the language you can also use that
